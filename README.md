# Hi, I'm Ethan!

I'm currently an Edge Hill University student studying a Computer Science Bachelor's degree.

I have been a tech nerd for as long as I can remember,  and there's nothing I love more than technology. Computers, networks, coding, operating systems, hardware, you name it. If it runs on electricity then I probably like it. I have exprience in using Python, Java, C# and SQL with Python being my strongest. I look forward to improving my coding skills even more on GitHub, while also connecting with the community.
